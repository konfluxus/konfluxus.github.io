        <h1 class="text-main">KONFLUXUS MANIFESTO</h1>
        <p>A stream is a continuously transmitted flow of data batches containing digital information.</p>
        <p>A livestream is a type of stream in which the server transmits events in real time through a live, continuous connection.</p>
        <p>Stream-art is performative livestreaming.</p>
        <p>Konfluxus is a stream-art collective.</p>
        <p>Stream-art is collaborative.</p>
        <p>Anyone can practice stream-art who has access to the following:</p>
    </div>
    <center>
        <ul style="width: 50%; text-align: center;" class="text-main">
            <li>A device connected to the internet</li>
            <li>Tools of becoming (e.g., camera, microphone, greenscreen, etc.)</li>
            <li>Intention</li>
        </ul>
    </center>
    <div style="text-align: center; width: 100%;" class="text-main">
        <p>The livestream will be the last digital medium that can hold reality accountable.</p>
        <p>Stream-art, as an act, opposes the hegemonic territorialization of the hyperspace. It resists the privatization of online connection. It is radically ungraspable. It is inevitably political.</p>
        <p>The present-ness of the stream is an oral superiority against censorship.</p>
        <p>Through its constantly changing, fragmented nature, stream-art denies the possibility of complete cognition. This quality is given meaning by the constancy of the camera.</p>
        <p>The camera is the only static point of the stream. The camera is a gateway, the stream is a window, Konfluxus is a transceiver.</p>
        <p>Konfluxus remixes reality through the greenscreen.</p>   
        <p>The greenscreen liberates the surface within the digital space.</p>
        <p>This surface enables both the evocation of the past and speculation about the future; it detaches time and democratizes video.</p>
        <p>Through the medium of the stream, Konfluxus glocalizes the visual language of the post-internet present: image entropy, anarchive.</p>
        <p>Konfluxus is a funnel where media and individuals flow into one another.</p>
        <code>
            fluxus = flow = stream
        </code>
        <p>Fluxus is an intermedial current.</p>
        <p>Konfluxus is fluxus.</p>
        <p>Fluxus is luxury.</p>
        <p>Konfluxus as a whole is more than the sum of its parts.</p>
        <p>Its actants and roles are permeable.</p>
        <p>Stream-art is a prayer towards  a direction, not an entity. The presumed or real receiver is just as essential as the presumed or real message.</p>
        <p>Konfluxus is always, at all times, open to interaction in both online and offline spaces.</p>
        <p>Konfluxus is a stage that welcomes everything that seeks to emerge.</p>
